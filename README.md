# To-Do List Application

## Description / Purpose
The To-Do List Application is a web-based tool designed to help users organize their tasks and activities efficiently. It allows users to create custom to-do lists, add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks or entire lists. This application simplifies task management and enhances productivity by providing a user-friendly interface for tracking pending and completed activities. Built using PHP, MySQL, and modern web technologies, it delivers a smooth and responsive experience for managing daily tasks.

## Dependencies
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or web server document root.
2. Import the `todo_list.sql` file into your MySQL database to set up the necessary tables. (Note: Adjust this step based on your actual SQL file name, if different.)
3. Configure your database connection in `connect.php` with your database user, password, and database name.
4. Access the application through your web browser by navigating to the directory where the files are located.

## Future Work
- Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their personal to-do lists securely.
- Add functionality for setting deadlines to tasks and providing reminders.
- Introduce the ability to categorize tasks within lists for better organization.
- Explore the integration of third-party APIs for enhanced task management features (e.g., calendar integration, weather forecasts for relevant tasks).

## Major and Project Relevance
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of my skills in web application development, database integration, and user interface design. It directly applies to my major by showcasing my ability to create practical, user-centric applications that address common needs. Developing this To-Do List Application has honed my problem-solving and technical skills, preparing me for a career in software engineering or web development.
